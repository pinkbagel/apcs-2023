## Study == Practice

You have to remember stuff.
You have to apply what you remember.

### How to remember this stuff

- See [Summary table of methods of recall](https://learning.subwiki.org/wiki/Summary_table_of_methods_of_recall)

What seems like it would work, but actually won't: Passive recall

- [Reading](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/csawesome/index.html)
- Watching [YouTubes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTAda7qU4LY)
- Reviewing your prior work.
- Watching someone else [solve problems](https://junilearning.com/blog/college-and-career/apcsa-2020-exam-sample-question-1-tutorial/), including your teacher.

What does work: Active recall

- Solve the problem again, without looking at a previous solution.
- Explain it out loud (your Teddy Bear ðŸ§¸ wants to learn recursion.)
- Make and use [Flashcards](http://www.supercs.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/AP-Flash_Cards_DOVI.pdf) (from [csawesome 12.1](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/csawesome/Tests/toctree.html))

### How to apply this stuff

Practice, the more the better. (You'll know when you've practiced enough.)

- Participating in sports? Your coach wants you to practice.
- Learning an instrument? Your music teacher wants you to practice.
- Learning to walk? ðŸ‘¶ Your parents want you to practice. You want to practice.
- Learning to code? I want you to practice.

> Your brain does not want to learn uselss stuff, and there is a good chance it thinks "inheritance" is useless stuff. Your brain is protecting you, so you can remember how to not get eaten by a shark ðŸ¦ˆ or something. Your brain has Priorities!

To help your brain understand that "iteration" is a priority, you have to actually **do** iteration. Practice coding `while` loops, `for` loops, recursive "loops". That's why we assign homework, labs, etc.

_If your only coding practice is during class_, your opportunities for practice are quite limited. Expand your opportunities!

- Code outside of class.
- You have a Codespace, so you can practice (with your Chromebook!) outside of class, and most anywhere!
- Code for 10, 15, 25 minutes at a time. There's no need to code for hours at a time.
- Code often. Code on Saturday morning. Code on Spring Break.

This is your best opportunity for success.
