# Unit 12, Lesson 4: Exploring Data

So yesterday didn't quite go according to plan. 😴

Again, that [Data Science Life Cycle](https://www.springboard.com/blog/data-science/data-science-process/) starts with collecting and cleaning, and that part is "time-consuming".

- Maybe you think it's cool! Maybe you'll be good at it!
- Maybe you could just hire somebody to do this?
- Maybe the AI could do it for you?

Takeaways for you:

- We can access unstructured data through pattern matching.
- Regular expressions are magic 🪄 and worth adding to your toolbox.

## Explore Data

Look again at `courses.ipynb`, where the "collecting" step now collects.  
For cleaning, what do we need to do?

- Can you find the courses you are taking? There's no AP CS next year!
- Duplicate courses, from duplicate sources of data?
  - where names might be slightly different?
- Courses with 1.0 credits, vs. A/B versions with 0.5 credits each

Export the CSV file, and open it in a spreadsheet program.

- How many teachers do we need to teach all these courses?
  - 2 semesters, < 7 periods

What other questions could we ask, of this data?

## Hey, what day is it?

There is more to Dates and Times than you might expect.

Let's talk about dates and times. [Dates and times can be tricky.](https://towardsdatascience.com/dates-times-calendars-the-universal-source-of-data-science-trauma-92a887fdedd1).

- Python (etc.) has https://www.strfti.me/
- Java has [DateTimeFormatter](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html)

How should we record dates?

- [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)
- `2023-05-09T14:05:32.123-07:00`
  - even sorts nicely!

## Hey, how long did it take?

Java has [java.time](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/package-summary.html).Period (days...) / Duration (seconds...) / Instant (point in time)

- [how to use 'em](https://www.baeldung.com/java-period-duration)

Python has [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) and timedelta

- The [problem with times and timezones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5wpm-gesOY)

## Sure, OK. Anyway...

[Seahawk Track & Field](https://www.athletic.net/team/396/track-and-field-outdoor/2023)

Let's explore some data: [`track.ipynb`]

- What questions could we ask of this data?

## TL;DR:

Takeaways for you, when confronted with dates and times:

- Always find some code
- Record dates in ISO-8601 format

## Options for Next Steps:

We could try to answer some questions about the data we have.

We could explore charts and graphs, and the underlying data.

We could catch up on our homework.

Look, I made 🐼s for the 2023 FRQs!
