# Unit 12, Lesson 6: Projects ðŸš§

Today is a propose-a-project day, and a catch-up day.

## Projects ðŸš§

By popular demand, we're going to do projects.

_(copied from yesterday)_

What do you want to build? What do you want to learn?

Come up with a proposal, and we'll agree on a rubric.

Constraints:

- It should involve some programming.
- It should involve learning something, beyond what you already know.
- It needs to be approved, and that will involve aspects of [Computational Thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking).
- Your project lives in Git version control.

Ideas:

- A game. learn [html5](https://html5gameengine.com/)? [Unity](https://unity.com/learn)?
- A mobile app. learn [react native](https://reactnative.dev/)? [flutter](https://flutter.dev/)?
- A web app. Interactive web report?.
- AI something? learn [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction/key-concepts) and [Prompt Engineering](https://learnprompting.org/)?
- something else? I have [plenty of ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14zm3vrHvqB2p53tD_axkgaxWJ41Lz5RWEH3q_OboxQ4/edit#heading=h.dxhg52f821py), and you've seen my style of ideas... ðŸ˜‰
  - like continuing [Unit 10's ACFL lab](../unit10/lab01acfl/README.md), for example.

Here's an example [proposal for a web app](proposal.md).

## Homework

Project Propsals are due Monday, May 15.

Write a [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github) file, including:

- a description of your project
- the components or steps involved
- the learning involved,
  - tools, techniques, technology.

Please ask me if you have any questions, or need inspiration.
