# Unit 12, Lesson 3: Collecting Data

Last week, I asked you to think about data ethics. What data should be collected, shared, protected, used, etc.?

Y'all did "Data Lab" back in the day, [remember](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-data-lab-student-guide.pdf)? There, you found some data and wrote a java program to answer some questions. For the next few days, we're going to do something similar, only this time we're going to play "Data Science." [Why???](https://www.youcubed.org/our-mission/)

Here's a [Data Science Life Cycle](https://www.springboard.com/blog/data-science/data-science-process/), which starts with collecting and cleaning.

- And a nice video about [careers in data science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYvhoH5AzHA)

For Data Lab, you found a data source and downloaded it. [Kaggle offers Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), with "quality data." Often, however, data is not in a tidy CSV file. We briefly looked at [ACFL trail maps](../unit10/lab01acfl/README.md), where the data was in there, but not very accessible. That's hard-mode, so we'll let that be for now.

## AHS Data

It takes a lot of data to run a school. We've got students, teachers, classes, and the rest. You non-seniors recently signed up for your next year's classes. Who's gonna teach those classes? Probably not me, but I'm curious about who is teaching what, when, as pretty soon I need to go apply for my teaching certificate which specifies the kinds of classes I could teach. There is not a lot of computer science courses in the catalog.

The [AHS website](https://www.asd103.org/ahs) offers a staff directory, and in the Counseling Center, there are various links for [Student Registration](https://www.asd103.org/AHS/Department/14-Counseling-Center/Portal/current-student-registration-2023-24).

How might we collect data for:

- AHS Teachers?
- AHS Courses?

Let's explore, and see what we need to learn along the way.

What data could you collect, that is interesting and potentially useful to you?

### Potential Resources

Under "For Families" is a [Staff Directory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/e/2PACX-1vSNzO5HPiUqIfe2VwPrLNzDvzygSiqJ6WekVJfOLmr0ILW28bDQkViDbavYgM5BDxitXmBs6oVPhDfW/pubhtml).

- It seems to be a google sheet, so I [copied it](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OhD_cd6O7a2Ncd785DfA9U3up31Y8gyX1wduhdOW0BQ/edit?usp=sharing) for inspection.
- Email addresses are hidden behind a "rich text" field. [HOWTO get them out](https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/89557/extract-the-link-text-and-url-from-a-hyperlinked-cell)

For courses, I found [several options](datasets/ahs23-24/):

- two pdfs offer lists of courses, plus eligibility?
- catalog has more, but is hard to extract from.
- [skyward-courses.txt](datasets/ahs23-24/skyward-courses.txt) is a export from skyward.

### What do we have, potentially?

- What do you notice about this data?
- What patterns do you recognize?
- What bits of data could we extract?
- How we gonna do that?
  - With Pattern Matching!

## Pattern Matching with Regular Expressions

Resources!

- a nice "Learn Regular Expressions" site: [regexone.com](https://regexone.com/).
- where we'll be doing our pattern matching: [Regular Expression Tester](https://regex101.com/).
- Python documentation for [Regular Expression Operations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html).

And here is a notebook to explore further: `courses.ipynb`

## Homework

Ungraded, but recommended before Thursday.

Mr. Peterson is old and boring, right? Who wants to collect data about classes and teachers? What data could **you** collect, that is interesting and potentially useful?

You are encouraged to identify some data and questions that are relevant to you. If you don't find any, we can proceed with mine, but we could also explore yours, instead!

Some ideas:

- [data about you](https://www.youcubed.org/tasks/dear-data/)
- social media something something?
- sports, from [youth](https://www.athletic.net/TrackAndField/meet/490322/results) to [professional](https://www.youcubed.org/downloadable/basketball-data-talk/)
- shopping, [local](https://skagit.craigslist.org/) or beyond
- [community happenings](https://docs.cityofanacortes.org/WebLink/CustomSearch.aspx?SearchName=PublicMeetingDocuments&dbid=0)
