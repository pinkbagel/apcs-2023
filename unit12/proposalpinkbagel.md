# Project Proposal: Dinosaur game spinoff
    The dinosaur game is what pops up on Chrome's offline page. It is a 2D horizontal game consisting of a dinosaur running infinitely, faster and faster until the player fails to dodge the obstacles (cacti and birds). 

    Instead of the dinosaur and desert setting, I will use a mouse runnning away from a cat. Obstacles will include mousetrap and cat paw.

## Decomposition

This project involves the following steps:
1. Creating sprites and background art (pixel art)
2. Research/learning more about Cs and Unity & animating sprites
3. Basic plan/layout of the game code
4. Executing! (code)
5. Incorporating the sprites on the place holder shape

## I will learn

- Coding in Python and Pygame
- Making sprites/animating in terms of games
