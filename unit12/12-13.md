# Unit 12, Lesson 13: Progress Projects!

Making solid progress, I hope? If you need help, summon me.

Need help later? Check your code into github and send me an email!

Need a second opinion? Ask AI!

Project Showcase, Demos, Presentations? should be the **week of June 5th**, maybe?

What can you get done by then? How can I help you?

- If you're preparing, think about transitioning to building.
- Overwhelmed? Decompose! Break it down into smaller pieces.

## Project Work!

Let's build.
