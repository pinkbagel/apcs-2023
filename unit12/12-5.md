# Unit 12, Lesson 5: Beyond Data‚ùì

For unit 12, I have a sequence in mind:

- Collecting Data -> Exploring Data -> Representations of Data
- Data Modeling -> Databases -> SQL & Data Reporting

And for Unit 13: networking and the Internet, RESTful APIs, etc.

Data is a fundamental part of very many future jobs, within and beyond Computer Science.

If we're not into that, here are the options:

- Projects üöß
- Labs ‚öóÔ∏è

## Option: Projects üöß

What do you want to build? What do you want to learn?

Come up with a proposal, and we'll agree on a rubric.

Constraints:

- It should involve some programming.
- It should involve learning something, beyond what you already know.
- It needs to be approved, and that will involve aspects of [Computational Thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking).
- Your project lives in Git version control.

Ideas:

- A game. learn [html5](https://html5gameengine.com/)? [Unity](https://unity.com/learn)?
- A mobile app. learn [react native](https://reactnative.dev/)? [flutter](https://flutter.dev/)?
- A web app. Interactive web report?.
- AI something? learn [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction/key-concepts) and [Prompt Engineering](https://learnprompting.org/)?
- something else? I have [plenty of ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14zm3vrHvqB2p53tD_axkgaxWJ41Lz5RWEH3q_OboxQ4/edit#heading=h.dxhg52f821py), and you've seen my style of ideas... üòâ
  - like continuing [Unit 10's ACFL lab](../unit10/lab01acfl/README.md), for example.

Here's an example [proposal for a web app](proposal.md).

## Option: Labs ‚öóÔ∏è

Lab 12-1: We can access and [explore some data](lab01data/README.md). AHS Courses! Track results!

Lab 12-2: We can design and build a "courses" database, and see what folks working in Database jobs do.

Lab 13-1: We can build a back-end web application, and see what that involves. [Java](https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/), [Python](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Javascript](https://blog.logrocket.com/build-rest-api-node-express-mysql/)

Lab 13-2: We can design a [user experience](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-basics-study-guide/)

Lab 13-3: We can build a front-end web application, and see what that work involves.

## Option: Courses, continued

Look again at `courses.ipynb`, where further steps now resolve duplicates.

- `alias` for names that sort-of match
- `related` for courses that are probably related. (A <-> B)

How about teachers? [`teachers.py`](datasets/ahs23-24/teachers.py) removes "ERROR" results.

We could identify subjects, and record data for course sections we know.

## Option: Catch up on homework!

- I found 7 "Data essays" and 7 "Techstack.md" entries.
- I did not carefully search your repos, and some grades may have not made it into Schoology yet.
