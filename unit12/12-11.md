# Unit 12, Lesson 11: Project, Progress Check

May marches on, folks! ðŸŒž

We have this week, half of next week, the week of June 5, and June 12.

Project Showcase, Demos, Presentations? should be the **week of June 5th**, maybe?

What can you get done by then? How can I help you?

- If you're preparing, think about transitioning to building.
- Overwhelmed? Decompose! Break it down into smaller pieces.

## Project Work!

Let's build.
