# Unit 12, Lesson 12: Prompting AI

## Welcome

Please find your way to an [AI model](https://www.fastcompany.com/90856183/30-ai-tools-you-can-try-for-free). Some of you can access [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/).

- No ChatGPT account? Try [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/) as a login-free alternative.

Next ask your AI "What is prompt engineering?"

- Then: "Use 2-3 sentences to explain the concept of prompt engineering to a high school student."

Ask the AI to answer something ambiguous.

- "My favorite class is"
- "High school students' favorite class is"

## Prompt Engineering

Generative AI, LLMs, and GPT-3 are all the rage these days.

How can these help us? What kind of use is potentially problematic?

Here's a slideshow with tips on Prompt Engineering: [Prompt Writing for AI](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16l4Z1OvNHEKC_n_knc7cZJD_IoZA55kTDmp-1WNXoV8/edit?usp=sharing) You could follow along, as it has things to try, within.

- Some text to analyze: [master-plan-part-deux](https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux)
- To play: here are some [math riddles](https://www.rd.com/list/math-riddles/), some [logic puzzles](https://www.rd.com/article/logic-puzzles/). See if the AI will solve them for you?
  - Hint: A "chain of thought" prompt will be helpful.

## Discussion

How do we use AI to support, rather than replace, our learning? Our value proposition?

How do we convince employers, etc. that we're worth hiring?

## Homework

Can AI help you with your project? What does AI say about your project?

- Describe your project as context
- Research options for User Experience, Gameplay, etc.
  - This counts as learning!

## Project Rubric

- 10 points for building something, with code in a repo. Got code?
- 10 points for learning something, beyond AP CS A curriculum. Got notes?
- 10 points if your project works, demonstrably.

Bonus points if it's awesome?
