# Unit 12, Lesson 9: Project Work!

## Servers and Clients, a brief lesson: ðŸ“œ

Web servers: hide in the cloud, and serve web pages.

Here's a "with minimal effort" option for java: [Spark Framework](http://sparkjava.com/)

Clients:

- web browsers, or
- other programs that make requests to web servers.

Clients and Servers communicate by sending messages over HTTP, the HyperText Transfer Protocol.

- [HTTP response status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)

Here's an example in Python & friends: [Tic-Tac-Rest](https://github.com/natoftheboonies/tic-tac-rest)

## Back to Project Work!

Nice project proposals, everyone! Let's get back to work!
