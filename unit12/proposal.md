# Project Proposal: Web App to maintain AFC #hashcodes

The AFC community outreach program produces a periodic [report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RyCfUrk4by9SqNUStuE6JU2Bz7ofb3orshPpcCiHxfY/edit?usp=sharing).  Existing software reads case notes recorded by outreach personnel, which include hashtags representing data they would like to report on.  For example, `#jobapp` translates to "Job applications prepared for clients" in the "Services" section of the report.

As these are sometimes invented, we need a tool to indicate which hashtags belong to which section of the report, and what the decoded report line should say.  For this project, I will build a web application to enable outreach personnel to create, update, and otherwise mantain hashtags, their section, and decoding.

The webapp will maintain the hashtag data in persistant storage, somewhere.

## Decomposition

This project involves the following steps:
1. Design a user interface for managing the hashtag data
2. Build a webapp to enable editing hashtags
3. Identify solution for storing data
4. Hook up persistant storage to the webapp
5. Deploy the application somewhere, and release to users.

## I will learn

- The [Svelte web framework](https://learn.svelte.dev/) 
- Hosting, for web and data
- Continuous Integration, to deploy my app to a web host.
