## What did I build?
    I built a 2D platform runner game that consists of a mouse(the player) trying to avoid the obstacles by jumping. It's basically a spinoff of google's dino game. 
    I used Unity and visual studios to program and Procreate to create the art.

## What did I learn?
    I learned how to work with Unity, how to work with sprites, and the basic components, scripts, and structure of 2D games. The most challenging part was of course learning how to use Unity and how to program in C#, but more specifically, creating the infinite background/ground was most difficult. I had to create a script that would move the ground and the background to the left and then create a new ground/background when the old one was off the screen, and I also had to create a script that would randomly generate obstacles and then destroy them when they were off the screen. Paying attention to smaller details played a big part. It took a long time to get used to Unity's interface and how to use it- To be honest, it was just a constant battle within myself to not give up.

    One thing that caught me off guard was that it was actually also very challenging to create sprites. I had to create the sprites in a way that they would look smooth with the animation, check if it's the right size and if they were in the right position. The sprites still don't look right though.

    Anyway, I learned a lot about 2D game development and the entire process was very hard but rewarding.

## How you can try it
    The game can be accessed by going to MouseGame>>Untitled Mouse Game.app.zip and downloading the zip file. 
    Use the space bar to jump. (There may be glitches)
