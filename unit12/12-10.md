# Unit 12, Lesson 10: Project Work!

## Servers and Clients, a scaffold!

I built you a scaffold! 🏗

A minimal [Spark Framework](http://sparkjava.com/) app is not quite as easy as a java file, so we now have a minimal Maven project. Maven is a [java build system](https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html).

The code is within `src/` and the `pom.xml` file is the Maven configuration.

To run it: Rebuild your container, as that will install Maven. Then navigate to `src/main/java/HelloSpark.java` and run it.

The client file, with a small amount of javascript, is in `src/main/resources/public/index.html`.

Incorporating your java project into this scaffold is a super option for learning new tricks! 🤓

## Back to Project Work!

Nice project proposals, everyone! Let's get back to work!
