### Data Ethics

	In today's world of rapid technological development, we are faced with countless issues that come within. Issues surrounding data ethics are not an exception. With diverse applications and softwares, there are several potential risks for consumers, including data collection, use, and sharing. Data ethics is not merely an option that companies can choose to consider; it is a core responsibility that protects consumers—but what should be considered a good data ethic?

	One key aspect of data ethics is transparency. Transparency refers to being open and honest about how data is collected and used, and giving consumers the power to access and control all of their data input. This is especially important when it comes to protecting the consumers’ rights. Unfortunately, most people do not read the entire list of the terms and conditions when installing a new app on their phone. In many cases, the terms and conditions are written and presented in a way that consumers lose interest or do not fully understand what they have read due to vague wording or diction. For example, Silent Circle(Youtube) conducted an interview where people on the street were asked to read what type of data that their apps could access or manipulate. Everyone was surprised—one of them quoted, “allow this app to record audio at any time without my confirmation.” This is, without a word, questionable. To solve this issue, the terms and conditions must be phrased and presented in a way that is easy to understand in the shortest amount of time possible. Additionally, aside from legal or technical matter, this is an issue of empathy and compassion. Companies or individuals who do not care about transparency often end up corrupt. Sensitive information such as medical records, personal emails, or bank details can be accessed or leaked without consent if consumers are not careful, which can have devastating consequences. A good example of transparency done right is the pop-up when an app or service needs a particular data or something enabled. You might get a pop-up that asks if you would like to enable your location for a new app that you installed, and you can always change your response at the settings app.

	Another important aspect of data ethics is fairness. Potential biases can be built into algorithms, data models, and data sets, and fairness ensures that data processing activities are nondiscriminatory. For example, many companies use algorithms to screen resumes and select candidates for job interviews, but if the algorithm is biased towards certain qualifications or educational backgrounds, it could lead to discriminatory outcomes. Companies must use unbiased algorithms and diverse data sets to ensure that every applicant is viewed fairly. 

    In conclusion, companies and individuals must adapt these core aspects: transparency and fairness. Though other aspects of data ethics exist, open honesty and unbiased algorithms are a big step towards ensuring that data storage and processing aligns with the principles of data ethics.
