# Unit 12, Lesson 1: Beyond Java

Hooray, the AP Exam is over! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ What shall we do next?

There is quite a lot more Java to learn. We didn't cover Networking, Concurrency, Lambdas, Generics, Reflection, Streams, and a whole bunch more Java. A CS degree will get you there, as will books, free online courses, and practice.

I heard "not Java" from a couple of you, so let's do something else.

## Beyond Java

We'll start with a survey of other languages. Which ones to survey?

- [Wisdom of crowds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measuring_programming_language_popularity)
  - [TIBOE](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/), [PYPL](http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html), [ieee.org](https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2022)

Let's have a look at some of them. [PiDay.java, ported](./piday/).

### How Languages Work: Compiled vs. Interpreted

- C is a compiled language. The compiler translates C source code into machine code. The machine executes the machine code.
- Java is a compiled language. The compiler translates Java source code into Java bytecode. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) interprets the bytecode. The JVM translates the bytecode into machine code. The machine executes the machine code.
- Python is an interpreted language. The interpreter translates Python source code into machine code. The machine executes the machine code.
- JavaScript is an interpreted language. The interpreter translates JavaScript source code into machine code. The machine executes the machine code.

### So which should I use, then?

- What are you building?
- Where does the code run?
- Is it accessible to me?

### Who already decided this?

Activity! How about the stuff we use? What are they coded in?

See [Tech Stack](techstack.md) and record your findings there.

Who would like to share their findings?

### Many options for what to learn next

Let's go see what the [Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages-loved) says.

Could you learn any of those? Of course! What else ya doing this summer? ;-)

JavaScript is everywhere.

- Frontend Web Development [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript)
- Backend Web: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- Mobile: [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- Desktop: [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/apps)
- Excel [Office Scripts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/scripts/), Google [Apps Script](https://www.google.com/script/start/), MacOS Automation, etc.

Python is super-popular:

- [Data science](https://www.simplilearn.com/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-data-scientist-article)
- Machine learning, subset of AI: [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- Backend web: [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
- Financial modeling and analysis [many](https://www.activestate.com/blog/top-10-python-packages-for-finance-and-financial-modeling/)
- Scripting and utility [Automate The Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)

C runs the world:

- [linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux), [windows](https://stygiansecurity.com/intro-to-windows-kernel-dev/#:~:text=Most%20of%20Windows%20programming%20is%20primarily%20done%20in%20C%2B%2B.)
- [jvm](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/tree/master/src/hotspot)
- python libraries ([numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy))
- javascript engine [v8](https://github.com/v8/v8)

What language you learn depends on what you'd like to do.

## Thinking Across Languages

Let's talk about "computational thinking." Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHWmnayy8MY).

In learning programming, you have learned a bit about think computationally. This is a skill that will serve you well in life.

## Computers and Data

Independent of programming languages, we have data.

What are you going to be when you grow up? Certainly, that will involve data.

- [21st century skills](https://www.k12.wa.us/student-success/career-technical-education-cte/cte-resources-essentials/21st-century-skills)

We use technology to help with data.

Let's talk about data. What is good data? What is bad data? Where does data come from? What story does data tell?

## Homework

- What do Google & others [know about you](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/162744?hl=en)?
  - Who else [knows about you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcjtEKNP05c)? (2m)
  - [Is your Privacy An Illusion?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMtrY6lbjcY) (20m)
- What data could you collect, that maybe you shouldn't?
  - What is [Algorithmic bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias)?
- What data should or should not be shared?

Please write a short essay ðŸ“œ with some opinions about data ethics. Due Monday.

Hey, I heard [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) can write essays! Indeed, there is a lot of prior thought out there about Data Ethics. So if you want to chat with AI, then have a conversation. Ask follow-up questions. Ask for evidence. Argue with it a bit. Come to your own conclusions. Then paste your conversation, and I'll evaluate your questions.

Please submit homework in [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github) and commit it to your GitHub repo.
