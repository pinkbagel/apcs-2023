# Unit 12, Lesson 2: From Java to Python 🐍

We began talking about data yesterday. I noted that [Data Science](https://www.simplilearn.com/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-data-scientist-article) is a hot field for a few days now, and it has [applicability to many fields](https://www.youcubed.org/resource/data-literacy/).

I also noted that you can program most anything in many languages, and that quite a lot of data science goes down in [Python](https://www.python.org/). So let's check out Python a bit, with ample use of the snake emoji. 🐍🐍🐍

## Jupyter Notebooks

[Project Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) is ... has a cool "interactive computing" notebook thing. Maybe you've seen it.

- The [Documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) links to a nice demo. (Except it takes a while to boot.)
- [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) is based on this.
- So are many other things, once you start exploring data science.

And of course, it runs in your VS Code. Update your codespace, restart it, and then open `hello_python.ipynb` (within the `unit12/` folder).

Here is another resource, from the University of Michigan "[Introduction to Data Science in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis)" course on Coursera: `IntroductionToCourse.ipynb`

## Today

Let's make this Jupyter stuff work, and explore Python a bit 🐍.

## Next Week

Data, Data, Data Science!
