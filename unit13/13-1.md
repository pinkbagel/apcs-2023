## Impact of AI

From the Center for AI Safety: 🤖 [Statement on AI Risk](https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk) 🤖

Also: [AI Doomerism is a Decoy](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/06/ai-regulation-sam-altman-bill-gates/674278/) by Wong, Matteo (2023, June 2) _The Atlantic._:

> The unstated assumption underlying the “extinction” fear is that AI is destined to become terrifyingly capable, turning these companies’ work into a kind of eschatology. “It makes the product seem more powerful,” Emily Bender, a computational linguist at the University of Washington, told me, “so powerful it might eliminate humanity.” That assumption provides a tacit advertisement: The CEOs, like demigods, are wielding a technology as transformative as fire, electricity, nuclear fission, or a pandemic-inducing virus. You’d be a fool not to invest. It’s also a posture that aims to inoculate them from criticism, copying the crisis communications of tobacco companies, oil magnates, and Facebook before: _Hey, don’t get mad at us; we begged them to regulate our product._

### What do we think, then?

- How is AI going to impact our future? What have you heard?
  - What are we excited for?
  - What are we afraid of?

Take a few minutes to discuss, and let's assemble our thoughts.

## Project Demos, Project Work

Is your project done? Stuff it in a folder add a README.md which answers:

1. What did you build?
2. What did you learn?
3. How can we try it?

Here is an [example project README](example.md).

Additionally:

- Is your project a web page? Host it on github.io [instructions](https://pages.github.com/) (project site).
- Does your project need API keys? **Don't** provide yours, but instead provide a link where a visitor can collect their own.
- Does your project have other dependencies? (Like a Discord channel?) Provide some instructions.
