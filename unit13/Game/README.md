## What did I build?
I built a 2D platform runner game that consists of a mouse(the player) trying to avoid the obstacles by jumping. It's basically a spinoff of google's dino game. 
I used Unity and visual studios to program and Procreate for the art.

## How you can try it
The game can be accessed by going to [pinkbagel.itch.io](https://pinkbagel.itch.io/mouse-game). 
Use the space bar to jump. (There may be glitches)   

## What did I learn?
I learned how to work with Unity, how to work with sprites, and the basic components, scripts, and structure of 2D games. The most challenging part was of course learning how to use Unity and how to program in C#, but more specifically, creating the infinite background/ground was most difficult. I had to create a script that would move the ground and the background to the left and then create a new ground/background when the old one was off the screen, and I also had to create a script that would randomly generate obstacles and then destroy them when they were off the screen.
One thing that caught me off guard was that it was actually also very challenging to create sprites. I had to create the sprites in a way that they would look smooth with the animation, check if it's the right size and if they were in the right position.
    
Anyway, I learned a lot about 2D game development and the entire process was very hard but rewarding.

-I used Zigurous(on github)'s dino game code and resources for guidance through the process & Transformice for the mouse inspiration.
