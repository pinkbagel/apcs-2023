AI is [changing jobs, across industries](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/ai-jobs-workplace/)

Probably, we'll just [have to work more](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/ai-chatgpt-productivity-work/674090/).

- "Vet it, edit, then take the credit"

And we'll have to [hear about it a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-P-ein58laA).

AI is [changing education](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/texas-am-chatgpt-ai-professor-flunks-students-false-claims-1234736601/)

- What will your teachers do?
- What will (other) students do?
- What will you do?

What should we do:

- to avoid being disadvantaged by AI?
- to avoid being replaced by AI?

## Project Rubric

- 10 points for building something, with code in a repo. Got code?
- 10 points for learning something, beyond AP CS A curriculum. Got notes?
- 10 points if your project works, demonstrably.

Bonus points if it's awesome?

Points go: towards Lab or Exam, your choice.

### What to do about a vague rubric?

Eventually, the rubrics run out. Que será, será?

Here's a couple of concepts that are worth practicing during your schooling, so that you're good at them when you start working.

#### Managing Up

_Hey ChatGPT_: "What are the fundamentals of managing up, to succeed at work?"

Managing up is a valuable skill that involves effectively working with and influencing your superiors, supervisors, or managers to achieve success in your workplace. Here are some fundamental principles of managing up:

1. Understand your manager's goals and expectations: Take the time to understand your manager's priorities, objectives, and preferred working style. This will help you align your own work and priorities accordingly, making it easier to meet their expectations.

2. Communicate proactively: Keep your manager informed about your progress, challenges, and achievements. Regularly provide updates on your projects and initiatives, and communicate any potential roadblocks or issues that may affect your work. By being proactive in your communication, you build trust and maintain transparency.

3. Anticipate needs: Try to anticipate your manager's needs and preferences. This includes being proactive in finding solutions to problems, suggesting improvements, or providing relevant information before they ask for it. By demonstrating initiative and foresight, you can save your manager time and contribute to their success.

4. Be solutions-oriented: Instead of just bringing up problems, focus on proposing potential solutions. Managers appreciate employees who not only identify issues but also offer well-thought-out suggestions for resolution. This demonstrates your problem-solving abilities and relieves some of the burdens from your manager.

5. Seek feedback and act on it: Actively seek feedback from your manager and be open to constructive criticism. Act on the feedback you receive and demonstrate your willingness to grow and improve. By continuously learning and adapting, you show your commitment to personal and professional development.

6. Build a positive relationship: Develop a positive and respectful working relationship with your manager. Be supportive, reliable, and responsive. Show enthusiasm for your work and demonstrate your commitment to the team's success. Building a strong rapport fosters trust, which is essential for effective managing up.

7. Manage your time and priorities effectively: Demonstrate good time management skills by meeting deadlines and delivering high-quality work. Prioritize tasks based on your manager's expectations and ensure that you are focusing on the most critical and impactful projects. This helps build confidence in your ability to manage your workload and meet objectives.

8. Develop your own expertise: Continuously develop your skills and knowledge to become a valuable asset to your manager and the organization. Stay up to date with industry trends, take relevant courses or certifications, and seek opportunities for professional growth. The more expertise you possess, the more valuable you become to your manager.

9. Be a team player: Collaborate effectively with your colleagues and demonstrate your ability to work well in a team. Support your teammates, share credit for collective accomplishments, and contribute to a positive work environment. By promoting a culture of teamwork, you showcase your leadership skills and enhance your relationship with your manager.

Remember that managing up is not about manipulating or controlling your manager. It is about building a productive partnership and leveraging that relationship to achieve mutual success. By applying these fundamentals, you can enhance your professional growth, increase your influence, and succeed in your workplace.

#### Advocating for Yourself

_Hey ChatGPT_: "How do I advocate for myself at work?"

Advocating for yourself at work is an important skill that allows you to assertively communicate your needs, accomplishments, and goals. Here are some strategies to effectively advocate for yourself:

1. Know your worth: Understand your value, skills, and contributions to the organization. Recognize your strengths, expertise, and the unique perspective you bring to your role. This self-awareness will give you the confidence to advocate for yourself.

2. Set clear goals: Establish clear and measurable goals that align with your professional aspirations. Share these goals with your manager or supervisor, and discuss how they can support you in achieving them. Regularly review your progress and provide updates on your achievements.

3. Communicate your accomplishments: Take the initiative to share your accomplishments and successes with your manager, colleagues, and other relevant stakeholders. Be specific about the impact of your work and how it aligns with the organization's goals. Regularly update your manager on your achievements during one-on-one meetings or through status reports.

4. Express your needs: Clearly communicate your needs and expectations to your manager. This may include requests for additional resources, training opportunities, or adjustments to your workload or responsibilities. Articulate how meeting these needs will benefit both you and the organization. Be prepared to discuss potential solutions and compromises.

5. Seek feedback: Actively seek feedback from your manager, colleagues, and clients. Request specific feedback on your performance, strengths, and areas for improvement. Use this feedback constructively to enhance your skills and demonstrate your commitment to growth. This ongoing feedback loop shows that you are invested in your development.

6. Take ownership of your professional development: Be proactive in identifying opportunities for professional growth. Research relevant courses, conferences, workshops, or certifications that can enhance your skills and knowledge. Present these opportunities to your manager, highlighting how they can benefit both you and the organization. Show your willingness to invest in your own development.

7. Build relationships and seek mentors: Cultivate relationships with colleagues, mentors, and advocates who can support and guide you. Seek mentors who can provide guidance, offer advice, and advocate for your professional growth. Engage in networking opportunities within and outside your organization to expand your support network.

8. Practice assertive communication: Develop assertive communication skills to effectively express your needs, concerns, and ideas. Clearly articulate your thoughts, ask for what you need, and express your opinions respectfully. Use "I" statements to take ownership of your perspective and avoid sounding accusatory or defensive.

9. Document your achievements: Keep a record of your accomplishments, including specific projects, initiatives, and outcomes. This documentation serves as evidence of your contributions and can be valuable during performance evaluations, salary negotiations, or when seeking new opportunities within the organization.

10. Be proactive and persistent: Take the initiative to pursue opportunities, express your interests, and advocate for yourself. Be persistent in pursuing your goals and needs, even if you face initial resistance. Maintain a positive attitude and demonstrate your commitment to your own success.

Remember, advocating for yourself is not about being self-centered or demanding. It's about confidently expressing your value, needs, and aspirations in a professional and respectful manner. By advocating for yourself, you position yourself for growth, advancement, and fulfillment in your career.

## Project Package

Is your project done? Done-enough? Stuff it in a folder add a README.md which answers:

1. What did you build?
2. What did you learn?
3. How can we try it?

Here is an [example project README](example.md).

I will collect these into a [projects.md](projects.md) document so we can "gallery walk."
