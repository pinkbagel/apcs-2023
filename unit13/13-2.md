## Project Demos, Project Work

Is your project done? Stuff it in a folder add a README.md which answers:

1. What did you build?
2. What did you learn?
3. How can we try it?

Here is an [example project README](example.md).

Additionally:

- Is your project a web page? Host it on github.io [instructions](https://pages.github.com/) ("Project site" > "Start from scratch").
- Does your project need API keys? **Don't** provide yours, but instead provide a link where a visitor can collect their own.
- Does your project have other dependencies? (Like a Discord channel?) Provide some instructions.
