# Unit 13, Lesson 4: Project Demos

Here's another [essay on AI in Education](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/my-class-required-ai-heres-what-ive) by a college professor teaching entrepreneurship and innovation.

Here's an index of your [projects.md](projects.md). I'll update it as you reveal them to me. :)

And finally, it's Friday. Stuff is due on Monday. The gradebook will close. ðŸ“•

## Project Package

Is your project done? Done-enough? Stuff it in a folder, on your github, and add a README.md which answers:

1. What did you build?
2. What did you learn?
3. How can we try it?

Here is an [example project README](example.md).

## Demonstrations

Who wants to show-and-tell today?
