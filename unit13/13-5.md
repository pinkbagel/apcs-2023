# Unit 13, Lesson 5: Course Retrospective

- Think for a moment: What do you wish was different about this course? ü§î

Retrospectives ("retros") are common in industry. My team at work has them [every 2 weeks](https://www.teamretro.com/) (which has questionable value) and when something bad happens. "RCA" = Root Cause Analysis.

- They are valuable at transitions points, such as the end of a school year.
- Idea: Reflect on the past to improve the future.

## Course Retrospective

[Class Retrospective](https://jamboard.google.com/d/14dSJ1nDFhJpdZjvgCxrO0zdJJ5vWtXPVT3RwpQFrdPU/edit?usp=sharing) Add colorful Notes üìù to each of the 4 "L" pages.

- 4Ls stand for **liked**, **learnt**, **lacked**, and **longed for**.

## Personal Retrospective

This exercise is worthwhile on your own, as well!

## Project Demos!

Some we will see! Others you can explore, here: [projects.md](projects.md)

- If I linked it wrong, please help me to correct it.

Write your project README.md, if you haven't. [Example](example.md)

## Sponge: Premortem

A postmortem is an analysis or discussion of an event after it is over. See also: Autopsy.

In a [premortem](https://hbr.org/2007/09/performing-a-project-premortem), we assume something will fail, and then explore the reasons for failure.

- For you college-bound seniors: imagine you are now graduating from college, and your future does not look bright. There is no job for you, you have no marketable qualifications, etc. What went wrong?
- For you college-bound juniors/sophomores: imagine it's [college decision day](https://blog.collegevine.com/national-college-decision-day/) and "none of the above" is looking like your best choice. What went wrong?
- Anyone: Imagine you're now 35 years old, and flat broke. What happened?

As with the retrospective, these kinds of exercises will help to steer you in a good direction.
