# Dice Games

Can we code these? Yes we can!

## Mexico

- Number of players: 2
- Number of dice: 2 rolling dice

Each player starts the game with 6 lives.
In the first round, all players take their turn and roll the 2 dice. Each player’s score in that round is simply the sum of both dice. The player with the lowest roll in that turn loses a life and has to change his personal dice accordingly (from 6 to 5 in the first round).
The game is continued and each round a player loses a life. When a player has lost all his or her lives, that player no longer participates in the game. The game ends when there is only one player left and all other players have lost all of their lives.

## "Beat That!”

A player who throws a six and a four would win the round as they have the higher number 64. After each throw, a player challenges the next player, “Beat that!” Play this game in rounds, assigning a winner to each round. First person to win 5 rounds wins the game.
