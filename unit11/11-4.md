# Unit 11, Lesson 04: AP Exam Scores

AP exam in [19 days](https://days.to/until/3-may). 🔜🔜🔜

## Warm-Up - Bell Ringer 20A!

You won't need your screen for a bit.

## Robots! 🤖🤖

[Ms. Jenkins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shannon-jenkins-pmp-42354a3/) is not a robot, but she's going to talk to us about robots.

## Write a FRQ 🧵

Alas, the AP exam is not a test of your ability to code a program. It is a test of your ability to hand-write a program under time constraints. So let's practice that, for 20 minutes. Don't worry, you'll get to finish it.

## Grade a FRQ

Trade your written FRQ with a neighbor or two. Let's [score them](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap16_computer_science_a_sg.pdf#page=2) together, and see what gives/takes the points.

## Code the FRQ

- Sync your GitHub repo.
- Start your Codespace (or your IDE)
- Pull the latest changes from GitHub.

Of course there's a 🐼. [`RandomStringChooser.java`](RandomStringChooser.java)

## Multiple Choice Practice

Let's [play a game](https://play.juicemind.com/)!

## Office Hours? 👩‍💻💻👨‍💻

Would you like to code with me after school? I can do this, but need advance notice.  
Today is coding club. If you would like to meet tomorrow, for example, please let me know.

## Sponge

Homework extravaganza! More FRQs, more MC, more practice.

## Essential knowledge

- All of it. Did you forget anything?

## Practice, Practice, Practice.
