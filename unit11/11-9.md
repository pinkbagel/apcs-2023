# Unit 11, Lesson 09: 🐝-Review

Let's start 🐝-Review for 30 minutes: [🐝-hive](b/B.md)

Then, we'll do a written FRQ.

Then, we'll grade the written FRQ.

Finally, we'll code the FRQ, and whatever else is left to code.

## The Month Progresses

AP exam in [11 days](https://days.to/until/3-may). 🔜🔜🔜

- Friday: 🐝-Review, and a written FRQ

## Homework

Commit your [`unit11/Crossword.java`](Crossword.java) solution to your GitHub repo.

### Alternative (was: Attention Math Team!)

You will miss Friday, when we do a paper-FRQ. Instead, please solve Project Euler [#11](https://projecteuler.net/problem=11) and/or [#13](https://projecteuler.net/problem=13) (with arrays, rather than `BigInteger`) to demonstrate your understanding of 2D arrays. See `EulerFriday#prob8scaffold` for an example of parsing the data, and you are welcome to collaborate.
