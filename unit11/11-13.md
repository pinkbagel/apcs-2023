# Unit 11, Lesson 13: Code Reviews

## Code Review some Dice Games

Standard operating procedure in software development is to have your code reviewed by a peer. This is called a code review.

Code can be evaluated in many ways. Here are some:

- _Correctness_ refers to “does the code run as intended?”
- _Design_ refers to “how well is the code designed?”
- _Style_ refers to “how aesthetically pleasing and consistent is the code?”

Let's look at some code and [evaluate it](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/code-review-best-practices/).

## Review Sorting/Searching

- Searching: Linear/Sequential vs. Binary
  - Linear search explores the list one element at a time, in order.
    - Takes O(n) time, meaning worst case is proportional to the size of the list.
  - Binary search explores the list by repeatedly dividing the list in half.
    - Requires the list to be sorted.
    - Takes O(log n) time, meaning worst case is proportional to the log of the size of the list.
      - log2 (n) = x means 2^x = n
- Sorting: Selection, Insertion, Bubble, Merge, Quicksort
  - Selection, Insertion, and Bubble are O(n^2).
    - O(n^2) take quadratic time, meaning worst case is proportional to the square of the size of the list.
    - Why? Because they compare pairs of elements.
  - Merge and Quicksort are O(n log n).
    - Recursive algorithms which divide the list in half
    - Merge divides the list in half, sorts each half, and then merges the two halves.
    - Quicksort partitions the list into two parts around a pivot.

## Homework

Study for the AP exam. [Active recall](https://www.brainscape.com/academy/active-recall-definition-studying/) is the best way to study.
