AP exam in ðŸ”œðŸ”œ [5 days](https://days.to/until/3-may). ðŸ”œðŸ”œðŸ”œ

# Unit 11, Lesson 12: Dice ðŸŽ²ðŸŽ²

Here we have a collection of [dice](dice.md) games. Here are [some more](https://party.lovetoknow.com/party-games-activities/10-fun-dice-games-adults). Look how much fun they're having!

Try a couple out, to understand the rules, and then let's code 'em.

Before you dive too deep into the code, let's talk about the design. What classes do you need? What methods? What fields? What are the relationships between the classes?

Probably the games don't need to be interactive, and then you could run them many times. Let's collect some statistics. Are they fair? How many rounds does it take to win? How does it change with >2 players?

Until 1:45, roll the dice and work on the design. Then we'll talk about it.

If you need a scaffold, ask the Internet.

We could also play [JuiceMind](https://play.juicemind.com/).

## Homework

Study for the AP exam. [Active recall](https://www.brainscape.com/academy/active-recall-definition-studying/) is the best way to study.
