# Unit 11, Lesson 05: Math

Math, a.k.a. Methods and Control Structures

## The Week Progresses

AP exam in [18 days](https://days.to/until/3-may). 🔜🔜🔜

## Warm-Up

- Sync your GitHub repo.
- Start your Codespace (or your IDE)
- Pull the latest changes from GitHub.

## Let's code some Math!

[ProjectEuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/) is a website with a bunch of math problems. They're not all easy, but they're all fun. Let's try a few. <-- AI wrote this

Open `unit11/`[`EulerFriday.java`](EulerFriday.java) and let's code together. Who wants to drive?

Who else wants to drive? How far can we get?

Commit your solutions for assignment credit. And sign up on Project Euler for internet points. 🏆

## Office Hours! 👩‍💻💻👨‍💻

Today after school. Next week, I'm not sure. I'll let you know.

## Practice, Practice, Practice.

## Homework

Let's make this one optional.

2020's FRQ: [Hailstone](Hailstone.md) 🪨

- `unit11/`[`Hailstone.java`](Hailstone.java)

This also looks suspicously like Project Euler [Problem #14](https://projecteuler.net/problem=14).

- Hint: some of those numbers are rather `long`.

Ungraded: Please complete Haley's survey: [CS Belongingness Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScqklcDVjD4kiJ-EDC_bnokFK-0QOGLlsjMthiZWxDfqyAidA/viewform)

- Haley is a college student studying CS in San Francisco. She has a paper due, so let's help out a fellow student with some data!
