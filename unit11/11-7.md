# Unit 11, Lesson 07: Boot Camp Drills

Onwards to 2D Arrays!

## The Month Progresses

AP exam in [14 days](https://days.to/until/3-may). 🔜🔜🔜

- Thursday: JuiceMind!
- Friday: Bell Ringer, and a written FRQ

## Warm-Up

- Sync your GitHub repo.
- Start your Codespace (or your IDE)
- Pull the latest changes from GitHub.

## FRQ-4: 2D Arrays

Complete two 2️⃣ FRQ puzzles, selected from the following list:

- Successors 🍞 ([2017 Q4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-frq-2017.pdf#page=16) page 16)
- ArrayTester 🧪 ([2018 Q4](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/ap/pdf/ap18-frq-computer-science-a.pdf#page=14) page 14)
- LightBoard 🚥 ([2019 Q4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap19-frq-computer-science-a.pdf#page=15) page 15)
- ArrayResizer 🍩 ([2021 Q4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap21-frq-computer-science-a.pdf#page=14) page 14))
- Data 📊 ([2022 Q4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap22-frq-computer-science-a.pdf#page=14) page 14)

Look for the 🐼 file in the `unit11/` folder.

Options:

- Independent work: Commit your work and push it to GitHub.
- Pair programming: sit with a partner, and take turns driving and navigating. To give your partner credit, commit your work and include their name in the commit message. (<mark>Valid for 1 FRQ</mark>, so swap for the second.)

## Homework

Commit two of the FRQ-4 puzzles above to your GitHub repo, or one each if you are doing pair programming.

### Attention Math Team!

You will miss Friday, when we do a paper-FRQ. Instead, please solve Project Euler [#11](https://projecteuler.net/problem=11) and/or [#13](https://projecteuler.net/problem=13) (with arrays, rather than `BigInteger`) to demonstrate your understanding of 2D arrays. See `EulerFriday#prob8scaffold` for an example of parsing the data, and you are welcome to collaborate.
