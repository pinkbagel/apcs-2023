# Unit 11, Lesson 03: Boot Camp Drills

## The Month Progresses

AP exam in [21 days](https://days.to/until/3-may). Minus weekends? Minus Wednesdays? 🔜

Schedule for the next 3 weeks:

- M/Tu: 2x FRQs (20m code + 15m discussion)
- Th: BellRinger, Paper FRQ -> Swap & Code & Score; [Group MCQs](https://www.juicemind.com/)
- F: Lab-ish FRQ-ish coding together.

Homework is what you don't finish in class.

# AP Exam Boot Camp

## Warm-Up

- Sync your GitHub repo.
- Start your Codespace (or your IDE)
- Commit your work!
- Sync the latest changes from GitHub.

## FRQ-2: Classes and Objects

Two FRQ puzzles, distributed randomly to students:

- StepTracker 🚶‍♀️ (2019 Q2)
- CodeWordChecker 📇 (2018 Q3)

  - Note: you no longer need to learn Interfaces, but this FRQ uses one. Interfaces are similar to superclasses, but instead of "extends" you use "implements". You can read more about them [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/createinterface.html), but all you need to know is: your class declaration `implements StringChecker` and must contain the `isValid` method. The stub code already has this.

Review the instructions for your puzzle, and code your solution. Finished early? Continue to the other puzzle. Still early? 4 more puzzles lie within `unit11/`!

After 25 minutes, we'll join into discussion groups to review both puzzles. Help one another!

Your homework is to commit both completed puzzles to your GitHub repo.
