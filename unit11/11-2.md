## The Month Progresses

AP exam in [22 days](https://days.to/until/3-may). Minus weekends? Minus Wednesdays? üîú

Schedule for the next 3 weeks:

- M/Tu: 2x FRQs (20m code + 15m discussion)
- Th: BellRinger, Paper FRQ -> Swap & Score -> Code, [Group MCQs](https://www.juicemind.com/)
- F: Lab-ish FRQ-ish coding together.

If you have known absences planned, please let me know.

# AP Exam Boot Camp

## Warm-Up

- Sync your GitHub repo.
- Start your Codespace
- Pull the latest changes from GitHub.

## FRQ-1: Methods and Control Structures

Two FRQ puzzles, distributed randomly to students:

- Frog Simulation üê∏ (2018 Q1)
- AP Calendar üìÖ (2019 Q1)

Review the instructions for your puzzle, and code your solution. Here is the [Java Quick Reference](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/ap/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-java-quick-reference_0.pdf) and your IDE knows this too. Finished early? Continue with the other puzzle.

After 25 minutes, we'll join into discussion groups to review both puzzles. Help one another!

Your homework is to commit both completed puzzles to your GitHub repo.

### Team Frog üê∏

- Aaliyah, Aaron, Billy, Kai, Marc, Marley, Mya, Mikiah
- Instructions: [Frog Simulation](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/apc/ap18-frq-computer-science-a.pdf#page=3)
- Code: [`FrogSimulation.java`](FrogSimulation.java)

### Team Calendar üìÖ

- Clara, Frank, Isaac, Logan, Max, Naomi, Noah, Sean, Tessa, Will
- Instructions: [AP Calendar](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap19-frq-computer-science-a.pdf#page=3)
- Code: [`APCalendar.java`](APCalendar.java)

### Discussion groups:

- Group 1: Marc, Marley, Tessa, Frank (meet by Frank/Marc)
- Group 2: Kai, Noah, Naomi, Billy, Sean (meet by Billy/Kai)
- Group 3: Clara, Logan, Mikiah, Aaron (meet by Clara/Logan)
- Group 4: Mya, Max, Aaliyah, Isaac, Will (meet by Isaac)

If my code works, each group should have 2-3 students from each team.
