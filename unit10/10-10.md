# Unit 10, Lesson 10: Recursion Exam!!

AP exam in [33 days](https://days.to/until/3-may). Minus weekends? Minus spring break? Minus Wednesdays? 🔜

## Unit 10 Exam

Recursion exam Today! In the woodshop, maybe?

- 17 MC, 2 code-a-function, a 4-part short-answer, 3 T/F = 50-60 min?

### Scoring the exam

- 3 points per correct multiple choice answer
  - possibity for 1 or 2 points if you SHOW YOUR WORK
- up to 5 points for each code-a-function
- 4 points for the 4-part part short answer
- 2 points per correct true/false answer
- A bonus question worth 5 points.

`17*3+2*5+3*2+4` = 71 points possible, with 5 bonus points.

Exams are worth 40 points, so here's the function:

```java
  static double scoreExam(int points) {
      return 40 * Math.sqrt(points / 71F);
  }
```
