# Unit 10, Lesson 08: Recursion resolution

Week 3 of Student Teaching. Maybe we're figuring this out?

## Essential knowledge

- What does this recursive function return?
  - The **base case** makes recursion stop.
  - The **recursive case**, calls the same function with a **changing argument**, approaching the base case.
- Sorting: Bubble, Insertion, and Selection sort exist, and work by comparing and swapping elements in an array.
- Searching:
  - Linear/Sequential search checks each element in an array for a match. If there are many elements, this takes a while.
  - Binary search can find things faster in a **sorted** array, by guessing in the middle.
    - Binary search finds things in log2(n) time.

### What's left to learn

- Recursive sorting functions: Merge sort, and Quicksort. These work recursively, by "divide and conquer"

## The Week Ahead

AP exam in [36 days](https://days.to/until/3-may). Minus weekends? Minus spring break? Minus Wednesdays? üîú

Let's wind up unit 10 and get on with the AP Exam review.

Recursion exam on Thursday!

- Monday: Recursive sorts üÉè and discuss Maze FRQ
- Tuesday: Bell Ringer. Homework review: PiDay, Shuffle, String sort. Q&A re: Exam?
- Thursday: Recursion exam. SpellingBee review? Boot Camp trailer.
- Friday: Welcome to Boot Camp! Maze FRQ review.

## Recursive sorts

If you read those Wikipedia pages [last week](10-4.md), they suggest not to use those algorithms.
These are better. Are they the best? What is the premium "sort" algorithm?

There's no "best sort" because sorting is a trade-off.

- Sometimes your input is random. Other times it's already sorted, or nearly sorted.
- Sometimes your input is short. Other times it is very long.
- Sometimes you need to sort "in place". Other times you can allocate more memory. Speed vs. Memory use is a common trade-off in computer science.

So let's explore two recursive sorts. I brought those cards again, and we'll work together to be recursive.

- [Merge Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)
- [Quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)

Again, I copied these off the internet, into [Scramble2.java](Scramble2.java).

We can use your Shuffle algorithm!

## Homework: Maze FRQ

Due Friday, March 31, before class begins.

FRQs are more fun when you actually get to code them!

Here is a FRQ (!!) that involves recursion (!!!) and a different sort of searching.

### Turning In Homework

It is increasingly difficult for me to discover your work. Let's discuss options...
