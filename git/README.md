# Version Control HOWTO

See also: [VS Code on Windows without Admin HOWTO](Window-NoAdmin.md).

GitHub uses [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for Version Control. Git is an industry standard, and [Git can be tricky](https://blog.upperlinecode.com/how-to-teach-git-commits-github-to-teenagers/). But everyone uses it, none the less. [Here is a comic](https://xkcd.com/1597/) about how that typically goes.

## Using Git in VS Code

VS Code tries to make it a bit easier. It still can be tricky. :)

To access version control, select the icon from the left navbar. It looks like a mini-tree.

Then, saving your code is a 2-step process.
To commit your code, first stage your changes by clicking the âž• icon:

![stage changes](stage-changes.png)

Do this for all files you'd like to save.

After staging your changes, you can commit them. Enter a message, and click the button.

VS Code may ask if you'd like to periodically run `git fetch`. Sure, this seems fine.

After you have saved your changes, use "Push" to send them to GitHub, and "Pull" to retrieve new changes from your GitHub repo to your Codespace (or local machine). These are both within the `...` menu at the top:

## Help I get Errors!

If it gives you an error ending in `fatal: Need to specify how to reconcile divergent branches.` then it offers a bit of help to resolve. I suggest the `# rebase` option. Copy+Paste+Enter into your "Terminal" window (bottom):

- `git config --global pull.rebase true`

Maybe this is sufficient to get you unstuck? If not, ask me and we'll add to this page. :-)
